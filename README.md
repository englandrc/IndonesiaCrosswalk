# IndonesiaCrosswalk
Code to extract and compile openly available location code history and correspondence.

Data downloaded from https://sig.bps.go.id/bridging-kode/index. Consists of two sets of files:

## 1. Historical Crosswalk
These files track administrative subdivisions in Indonesia throughout time. For provinces (*provinsi*) and districts (*kabupaten*), the earliest available data point is from the 1961 Census, whereas for lower level subdivisions the earliest available data is from the 2010 Census.

## 2. MoHA Concordance
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA)/*Kementerian Dalam Negeri (Kemendagri)* maintains their own set of administrative location identifiers. Aside from BPS' codes it is the other widely used set of location codes in Indonesia. The concordance here is between MoHA codes as per 2017 with BPS codes as per Semester 2 of 2017.
